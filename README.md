In this project our team aims to predict the likelihood of an accident occurring based on the different factors a driver faces. The data comes from car crash data collected across the state of Virginia by the Department of Motorized Vehicles. Some of the important features identified in this project are the speed limit, day of the week, weather condition, visibility level, intersection type, and population density. Since all of the data in the dataset represents a crash that occurred, the models used needed to be able to perform outlier detection. The models used were one class support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, and isolation forest. With the one class SVM the different kernels tested were rbf, polynomial, and linear. Overall the isolation forest model achieved the best accuracy on the testing set with 89.7% and an F1-score of 0.946.
